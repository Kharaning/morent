# Description
it was first time using Tailwind CSS, i really liked the concept of Tailwind , it really makes writing css faster and it is highly customizable, but its little bit hard to remember all those shortcuts at first sight. i will probably use Tailwind in future but mostly on big projects.

Also it was first touch with React Router, at first it was little bit confusing but i'm learning it .
